# Our goal

Levin is a website that allows any user to create dynamic
sitemaps. The site is bare bones, intending to keep the
focus on building a sitemap. The goal is to help users
document their ideas in a way that is easy to interpret
without extensive knowledge of web development.

Usually, sitemap websites are challenging to use because
their canvas has too much to offer. Levin simplifies this by
offering one button on the canvas page, which generates
however many containers a user needs. Our canvas page
can be moved (by holding the left mouse button and dragging),
allowing users to make sitemaps that are big as their ideas.
Our containers can be manipulated and linked to the users'
liking. Modifications include changing the container's color
(clicking on the container's footer generates a random color)
and adding text (double-click the text area and click enter when
done). If a user wants to remove a container, they can right-click
it to delete it. Once a user is happy with their sitemap, they can
right-click the canvas and save it as an image to share (if the
text does not show up within the image, make sure to click
enter on the specific container for the canvas to render it).

Levin offers other functionalities related to accounts (sign up,
log in, and forgot password) and tutorials. All these can be
accessed by clicking on their respective icons on the sidebar.
When clicked on, a pop-up (aka modal) gives users access
to these other functionalities. This is done so that Levin's
necessary information can be accessed from the canvas page.

As stated before, Levin is simple in design to offer a blank
canvas feeling to users. I hope you enjoy using the website
as much as we did making it.
